Dear Councillor [councillorName],

I am writing to raise a serious complaint regarding the persistent fires and toxic smoke in my area near Madelvic Factory. This is not the first time the community has raised this issue—discussions on this matter date back to last year, yet nothing has changed. The fires continue, the smoke remains thick and hazardous, and the response from public services has been wholly inadequate.

I, [Your Name] (Address: [Your Address]), along with other affected members of the community, have been suffering due to:

- Thick, toxic smoke seeping into homes due to the wind
- Severe public nuisance and health risks
- Repeated occurrences throughout the day

We demand:
1. Immediate action to extinguish these fires
2. A formal explanation for the year-long inaction
3. Clear accountability for enforcement responsibility

I expect a prompt and detailed response.

Regards,
[Your Name]

Dear [MSP Name],

I am reaching out to you regarding a severe public health and environmental issue that has been affecting our community. Repeated fires are producing thick, toxic smoke that is seeping into homes, creating serious health risks. Despite numerous complaints, the fire service and local authorities have failed to act.

Residents have been suffering due to:
- Ongoing exposure to hazardous smoke and fumes
- Severe public nuisance, making breathing in our own homes difficult
- A complete failure of public services to address a critical health hazard

I urge you to:
- Raise this matter in the Scottish Parliament and demand accountability from SFRS and the Scottish Government
- Push for urgent intervention to put an end to these fires and protect residents
- Seek answers from relevant agencies on why this issue has persisted for over a year

We expect our elected representatives to stand up for their constituents’ health and safety. 
I look forward to your response and support.

Regards,
[Your Name]

Dear Edinburgh Council,

I am writing to formally express my deep concern regarding the ongoing issue of frequent fires in our local area, which have been occurring on a weekly basis and producing dangerous smoke and pollution.

Despite numerous complaints and reports from concerned residents, it appears that little to no action has been taken by your agency to mitigate this hazardous situation. The thick smoke and air pollution resulting from these fires pose significant health risks to the community, particularly to children, the elderly, and individuals with respiratory conditions such as asthma. In addition to health concerns, persistent air pollution degrades our local environment and overall quality of life.

We as a community, expect you to take immediate and effective measures to:
- Investigate the causes of these fires
- Enforce environmental regulations
- Implement solutions to prevent further occurrences
- Provide transparency regarding ongoing efforts or planned actions

As a concerned citizen, I urge you to prioritize this matter and provide a timely response outlining the steps being taken to resolve the issue. The community cannot continue to suffer the consequences of inaction. If no prompt action is taken, we will escalate our concerns to higher authorities and the media.

Please provide a timeline for your investigation and intervention at your earliest convenience.

Regards,
[Your Name]

Dear SFRS,

I am writing to raise a complaint regarding the persistent fires and toxic smoke in my area. This is not the first time the community has reported this issue - with discussions dating back years. Your service has repeatedly refused to put them out, claiming they are “controlled” despite clear evidence of harm to residents.

The community is suffering due to:
- Thick, toxic smoke seeping into homes due to the wind
- Severe public nuisance and health risks, especially for vulnerable residents
- Repeated fires throughout the day and across multiple days, with firefighters failing to extinguish them

I would like:
- Immediate and decisive action to put out these fires and prevent further occurrences
- A formal explanation as to why SFRS has refused to intervene despite clear evidence of harm

Please provide a timeline for your investigation at your earliest convenience.
